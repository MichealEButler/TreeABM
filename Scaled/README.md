# TreeABM

Current version of agent-based modelling environment for simulating tree growth with human agent interaction. The construction of this simulation environment is intended to be used to investigate the effect of human interaction in wooded environments of early Holocene Europe, and will be submitted as part of my doctoral research. This research is integrated into the ERC funded Europe's Lost Frontiers project, and will also be used to extend further agent-based models being constructed as part of this project.
